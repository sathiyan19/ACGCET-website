Also, our Music Club and Rotaract Club of our college together organize a grand musical event in the name of “Shrishti” every year for a good cause. Tickets will be sold and a big part of the collection will be provided for orphanages.

With this intention,we have named our club – ‘BAND AROHANAM’.",
