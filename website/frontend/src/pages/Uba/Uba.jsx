          Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi working for a long in the
          area of rural development and appropriate technology. The concept was
          nurtured through wide consultation with the representatives of a
          number of technical institutions, Rural Technology Action Group
          (RuTAG) coordinators, voluntary organizations, and government
          agencies, actively involved in rural development work, during a
          National workshop held at IIT Delhi in September 2014. The workshop
