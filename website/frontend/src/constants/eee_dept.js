In the Electrical Drives Laboratory, we used the 3 phase induction motor and monitored the parameters like voltage, current, speed using the drives setup.',
              'content_2':"We generated pulses for the 3 phase induction motor using LabVIEW and interfaced with the inverter using CompactRIO. In our project, we faced a lot of problems which include generation of pulses for the inverter (which is a high frequency pulse). We also faced challenges in interfacing with CRIO. Our faculty members made it easy for us to work in the Drives laboratory. Everyone gave us freedom to experiment our technical thoughts."

Additionally, we implemented voice mode controlled operation of the project, aiding the visually impaired in operating the drive. Today I feel grateful to the faculty members of EEE for giving me an amazing opportunity to work on the DC motor drive using LabVIEW. The project played a pivotal role in helping me receive an internship opportunity in Danfoss Drives Ltd., after my graduation. Thanks,"
